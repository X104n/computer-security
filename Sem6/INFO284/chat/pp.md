# k-nearest neighbors (**kNN**)

When talking about k-nearest neighbors (kNN) algorithm, Euclidean, Manhattan, Chebyshev, and Jaccard are various distance or similarity metrics used to measure the distance or similarity between data points in a multidimensional space. These metrics help determine the "nearest neighbors" for a given data point.

    1. Euclidean distance: It is the most common distance metric, often referred to as the "ordinary" straight-line distance between two points in Euclidean space. Mathematically, it is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squared differences between the corresponding coordinates of the two points.

    2. Manhattan distance: Also known as the L1 distance or city block distance, Manhattan distance measures the distance between two points as the sum of the absolute differences of their coordinates. It is called Manhattan distance because it represents the distance a car would drive in a city like Manhattan, where streets are arranged in a grid pattern.

    3. Chebyshev distance: Also known as the L-infinity distance or maximum metric, Chebyshev distance measures the distance between two points as the maximum absolute difference between their coordinates along any single dimension. In other words, it represents the minimum number of moves a chess king would need to move from one point to another on a chessboard.

    4. Jaccard similarity: This is not a distance metric but a similarity measure, often used for binary or categorical data. It calculates the ratio of the number of common features (or attributes) to the number of features that are present in at least one of the data points. The Jaccard distance is calculated as 1 minus the Jaccard similarity.

In the context of kNN, these metrics help define the "neighborhood" for a given data point and are crucial in determining the accuracy of the kNN algorithm's predictions or classifications. The choice of distance metric depends on the nature of the data and the problem being solved.
