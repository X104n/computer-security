NB: When defining things, be careful to define all prerequisites, e.g. if defining nonlineaity as the smallest Hamming distance between a component function and an affine Boolean function, you should also briefly explian what a component function is and what is the Hamming distance

CLASSIC CIPHERS
	(encrypt or decrypt some message, describe how a cipher works)
	- Caesar cipher
	- Vigenere cipher
	- monoalphabetic substitution cipher
	- Playfair cipher

STREAM CIPHERS
	(problems on LFSRs - convert between representations, simulate an LFSR, relation between primitive polynomials and LFSRs, describe how an LFSR can be attacked)

BLOCK CIPHERS
	(describe parts of a Feistel work - single round, how decryption is performed, why is DES not secure anymore, describe the meet-in-the middle attack, how does the meet-in-the-middle affect the security of "repeated ciphers" like 3DES)
	(AES - describe one round, how decryption works)

MATHS
	- finite fields (describe how to construct a finite field, how to add and multiply elements to gether; do actual addition, multiplication, exponentiation for a given field with an irreducible polynomial; define a primitive polynomial; check whether a polynomial is primitive; relation between primitive, irreducible and having root)
	[ primitive => irreducible => has no root ]
	
BOOLEAN FUNCTIONS
	- define (n,m)-function
	- define cryptographic properties and the attacks that they resist (differential uniformity, nonlinearity
	- give examples of (n,m)-function used in block ciphers

ASYMMETRIC CRYPTOGRAPHY
	- explain the difference between symmetric and asymmetric cryptography, give the advantages (applications) and disadvantages, give examples of encryption algorithms for both
	- RSA (describe how it works, compute basic example, e.g. encrypt, decrypt, find the private from the public key, verify that something is a valid key pair)
	- efficiency optimizations for RSA: square-and-multiply, short public exponents, Chinese remainder theorem (just mention it)
	- DHKE (how it works, compute basic example)
	- Elgamal (how it works, compute basic example, why is Elgamal malleable and what does it mean)
	- why are elliptic curves useful in cryptography (literally the only thing you have to say about elliptic curves)

DIGITAL SIGNATURES
	- explain the basic principles
	- RSA (how it works, compute basic example)
	- Elgamal (how it works, compute basic example)

HASH FUNCTIONS
	- what is a hash function?
	- desirable properties (pre-image resistance, collision resistance, strong collision resistance)
	- how can you build a block cipher from a hash function? (lasts lide in lecture 10)

MODES OF OPERATION
	- what is it?
	- list some popular modes of operation (ECB, CBC, OFB, etc.)
	- ECB: how it works, what are its problems
	- GCM: what additional security service does it provide?
	- maybe just remember one of the non-ECB modes

MODULAR ARITHMETIC
	- computes something to the power of something modulo something
