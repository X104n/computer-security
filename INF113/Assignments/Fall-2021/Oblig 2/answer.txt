So in this code i have used a semaphore which i have titled "lock" to keep track of the "line" variable. So whenever i use this variable in an if statment or want too update the varable i use a semaphore such that only one thread can access it at a time.

I also use a semaphore to keep the queue in order. And in this instace i have to presume that the semaphore keeps track of the queue. I can see that this isnt something to rely on, but in my instace i belive it is sufficent enough.

For theese two semaphore above i have used them as a lock which is also known as Binary semaphores where the defined initial value is 1.

As of the rest of the semaphores they have been defined with the initial value of 0 to make them wait for the other part to finnis and then "unlock" them.

For the last two semaphores they keep the balance between the patient/car and the doctor. And since the vaccine method is inside of the queue semaphore it can only be run by one car at a time. Thus this solution only would work with one doctor which is what this instance have.
